# App-design-for-EV-Battery-Swapping-model
Mobile application UI and CAD design for a project on "Hot swappable Li-ion battery model for E-rikshaw"
UI Design for a bluetooth based mobile app that will provide real time relevant vehicular data like battery capacity, estimated range and nearby charging and battery swapping stations that will be displayed to the driver.
1) Li-Ion Cell:
This is a lithium ion cell used to create High capacity battery setup in a lightweight, compact design
Lithium-ion batteries have higher energy densities than lead-acid batteries, so it is possible to make the battery size smaller than others while retaining the same storage capacity.
2)Cartridge:
The batteries are stacked together in a cartridge system and places in the box that we device to replace the prevalent battery in the E-rikshaw. It is the system that can be swapped at a charging station.
3)Application model:
Because these cartridges are hot swappable i.e. no more waiting to get the battery to charge up, simply pop out the discharged cartridge, install a new one and you are good to go again in no time, this will significantly increase the running hours. With this we are also proposing a credit based lease system where charging stations will be located in the busy locations where one can go and quickly swap the dead cartridges for the changed ones for free bucks this means no more long charging breaks during busy day time.
5)The Tech:
But this is not it, these batteries are also equipped with various sensors and monitors which will provide valuable metrics to the owner and the driver like the range left, nearest charging station, battery usage etc. all this through a smartphone app that connects to the onboard computer via bluetooth.
